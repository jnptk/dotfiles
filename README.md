### 🗂️ dotfiles

Welcome to the secret lair of my dotfiles. Here lies the configuration magic that makes my terminal, shell, and other tools behave exactly the way I like them.

#### 🛠 Installation

Clone this repo (and it's submodules):

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules git@github.com:jnptk/dotfiles.git
```

Run the installer:

```bash
./install.sh
```

Restart your terminal and enjoy!
